# CS2420 MAZES

For this project you will work in groups of 1-4 of your own choosing.
Most of the work will be done in class and you should commit your code
 at the end of class each day. You may need to do some work outside of class. You will need to attend class all four days.  If you cannot make it all four days you will need to be in your own group or in a group of other individuals who will do more work outside of class.

You will need to write a Maze class that can generate, print, store,
 and solve mazes.
There are no test cases for this assignment.
Instead there are a series of challenges that you can implement.
The are listed below in approximate order of difficulty:

+ Print a maze. (Hard code one in using a default constructor)
+ Store a maze read from a file.
